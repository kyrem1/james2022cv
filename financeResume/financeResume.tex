\begin{center}
  I am a mathematics and computer science double major at the University of Virginia with a comprehensive undergraduate and graduate-level mathematics background. My primary interests are in operator algerbas and noncommutative geometry.

\vspace{1.0em}
  Following my PhD, I plan to pivot towards the financial sector with a focus on quantitative finance and algorithmic trading.
\end{center}

\section{Mathematics Experience}

\begin{itemize}
  \item At the University of South Florida during high school, I completed the majority of courses in a mathematics major as well as a variety of graduate-level courses.
  \item Took the same mathematics courseload as UVA's 1st year mathematics PhD students (and more) during my freshman year. Passed the analysis (real \& complex) PhD qualifying exams.
  \item Last summer, I took an intensive one-on-one reading course in operator algebras with one of my professors. Living expenses were covered by a grant (see below).  
  \item I am a member of the UVA operator theory seminar for graduate students, at which I have given two lectures on type $ II_1 $ subfactor theory for von Neumann algebras.
  \item \textbf{Graduate level courses taken}: Functional Analysis, Measure Theory, Complex Analysis, Differential Topology, Algebraic Topology, Algebraic Geometry, Representation Theory, Algebra II, Algebra I, Applied Partial Differential Equations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Financial Experience}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Member of UVA's Alternative Investment Fund}\quad An investment club managing a portfolio of $ \$50,000 $ AUM. Rigorous selection process with multiple interviews and a $ 3\% $ acceptance rate. This club includes an extensive training program for new members. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Programming Experience}
\textbf{Proficient In}\quad Java, C++, Python, Javascript (see my github above) \\
\textbf{Using scientific-computing software (SageMath, Mathematica)}\quad level: medium \\
\textbf{Using document markup software (\LaTeX, Office Suite)}\quad level: advanced \\
\textbf{Using Linux}\quad level: medium. (I currently run Arch-Linux on my main laptop)

\section{Honors and Awards}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Various Grants/Funding/Travel (see my website for more info)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \$2000 Supporting summer research in operator algebras alongside Dr. Benjamin Hayes.
    \item \$500 For travel to the Notre Dame workshop in Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms
    \item \$1000 Supporting travel fees to attend the East Coast Operator Algebras Seminar. 
    \item \$1500 Supporting travel fees to attend the Joint Mathematics Meetings
  \end{itemize}
  \item Mathematics PhD Qualifying Exams - Passed Real \& Complex Analsyis Exams (as a freshman)
